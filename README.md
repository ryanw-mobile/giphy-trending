This is a sample app based on the walkthrough(https://medium.com/codex/android-tutorial-part-1-using-room-with-rxjava-2-dagger-2-kotlin-and-mvvm-f8a54f77d3fa) by Fahri Can. 

Skills covered:
* Kotlin
* ViewModel / MVVM architecture
* Data Binding
* Live Data
* Retrofit 2
* RxJava 2
* Glide
* Dagger 2

I have modified the UI design to make it look like a production-ready product.
